#### Project Background and motivation
There are so many resources on the internet for learning Data science and well as a vast number of machine learning techniques from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning based methods. It may be very confusing for someone trying to break into the field to get a grasp of exactly what to learn. Since I'm trying to break into the field myself, I decided to explore Kaggle's 2020 data science survey. It consists of about 20,000 responses, both from students and professionals about their age, education ,job roles and large variety of other profession related topics.In this analysis, I tried looking at the professionals and data science practices of companies, both large and small and try to find patterns in professionals within a job role and across job roles
