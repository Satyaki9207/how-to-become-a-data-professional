### Please find the detailed analysis report in this [post here](https://xlr892.medium.com/becoming-a-data-professional-in-2021-71c886b59536)

#### Data used for the analysis can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2020/data)

#### Project motivation
There are so many resources on the internet for learning Data science and well as a vast number of machine learning techniques from simple linear regression to advanced deep learning based methods. It may be very confusing for someone trying to break into the field to get a grasp of exactly what to learn. Since I'm trying to break into the field myself, I decided to explore Kaggle's 2020 data science survey. It consists of about 20,000 responses, both from students and professionals about their age, education ,job roles and large variety of other profession related topics.In this analysis, I tried looking at the professionals and data science practices of companies, both large and small and try to find patterns in professionals within a job role and across job roles

#### Dependencies
+ Python 3.7 or higher  
+ Jupyter notebook  
+ numpy  
+ pandas  
+ matplotlib  
+ seaborn  

#### Files in the Repository
images - folder containing the visualizations for different questions explored in the analysis  
Supplementary data- contains information on how the survey was conducted and the descriptions and options for each question  
becoming a data professional...ipynb- The file containing all the code for generating the visualizations

kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv- file containing the survey responses 

#### Results Summary
+ country of residence plays a big part in determining salaries of data professionals
+ Most professionals across job titles have a bachelor's or a master's degree
+ Data scientists form the biggest portion of people working with data
+ Pay increases with experience and company size
+ Python and SQL are go to languages to learn for any data related role
+ A good portion of people working in this feild have less than 2 years of experience with coding and ML and is a reasonable goal for newcomers to strive towards
+ Businesses value deriving insights from data and simple ML algorithms over complex ones
